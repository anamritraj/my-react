<h1 align="center">My React</h1> 

> A super simple implemetation of [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) for understanding how ReactJS works under the hood.


## What?
It is a basic version of React.js which tries to implement functions from original ReactJs library.

## Why?
I always wanted to contribute to react but coudn't since I didn't know where to start. The current codebase of ReactJs is really big and its overwhelming to start looking at it.

So I created this, MyReact.js, a simple implementation of the ideas from ReactJs. I will be implementing some basic functionality first and then move on to some advanced stuff like its `Fiber reconciler` and `context` and `hooks` maybe!

## How to Setup?
Its pretty basic right now. There's only one function implemented `MyReact.render`. So I have literally put the entire library in one file and loading it from the `demo/index.html` file.

Just open `demo/index.html` in any browser and you should be able to see the result. No need to run a webserver, it can run over the file protocol for now.

## Contribution Guide
Feel free to fork and create issues for the features you want to see.

I am open to suggestions and would love to hear from you guys. Let's learn together!
